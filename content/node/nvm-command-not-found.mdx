If there is an 'nvm not found error' whenever new terminal is opened, just follow this instructions.

```bash
âžœ  ~ nvm --version
zsh: command not found: nvm
```

Than load .bash_profile

```bash
code ~/.bash_profile
```

Than write this code inside:

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
```
