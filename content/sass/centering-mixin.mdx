Assuming the parent element has position: relative;, these four properties will center a child element both horizontally and vertically inside, no matter what the width of height of either are.

```css
 @mixin centerer {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

```css
.parent {
  position: relative;
}
.child {
  @include centerer;
}
```
